Contributing to Math-Polynomial
===============================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this Perl 5
library.  Currently, it is in active development and maintained
by its original author.  Bug reports (with or without patch),
suggestions, feature requests, and comments are welcome.  You may
submit them through this distribution's bug tracker on github:
https://github.com/mhasch/perl-Math-Polynomial/issues

You can also reach the author by e-mail:

If your contribution is accepted, you will be mentioned by name under
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS in the documentation.  Please indicate if you prefer
an alias or to stay anonymous.

Development Guidelines
----------------------

This library, dealing with a mathematical concept, should first and
foremost be scientifically sound.  Correctness is rated over all other
quality aspects.  The second most important goal is a documentation and
over-all presentation that makes it useful for experts and informative
for anybody interested in the field.  Thirdly, it should be easy to
integrate correctly and efficiently with other software.

Topics of interest
------------------

Possible improvements may address performance, perhaps by making
third-party math libraries available as backends, or functionality,
by adding missing operators like resultant and discriminant, or
interoperability with other computer algebra libraries, or of course
documentation.

A number of possible extensions, as outlined in the section "EXTENSION
GUIDELINES" in the main documentation, could be maintained either within
the same library or separately.  The scope of the library here is general
functionality with few assumptions about coefficient spaces.  Thus,
an implementation variant optimized for sparse polynomials may fit here
very well, while polynomial factoring algorithms, say, probably won't.

Author's Note
-------------

Thanks again for your interest.
I am looking forward to your report or e-mail.
