        - Repackaged after Math-Polynomial-1.000.tar.gz had file transmission

1.000   2009-05-19
        - Author: Martin Becker
        - Rewritten from scratch, using
          h2xs 1.23 with options -X -A -b 5.6.0 Math::Polynomial
        - Usable coefficient spaces are now any object classes with
          well-defined basic arithmetic operations and equality checks.
        - Objects are now essentially immutable.  The only property that
          may be changed dynamically configures formatting defaults.
          Thus, cloning is hardly ever necessary.
        - Removed tidy() and size() methods and dropped tidiness concept,
          as it bore no mathematical significance.
        - Degrees of coefficients in new() are now in ascending order and
          therefore equivalent to array indexes.
        - Added monomial constructor.
        - Changed Lagrange interpolation to take arrays of x- and y-values.
        - Extended constructors to borrow coefficient space and
          stringification attributes when used as object methods.
        - Added usage of coeff() without parameter, yielding list of
          all coefficients.
        - Added coefficients() method, yielding non-empty list of
          coefficients.
        - Added coeff_zero() and coeff_one() methods, yielding zero and unit
          elements of coefficient space.
        - Added proper_degree() method yielding undef for zero polynomials.
        - Added is_zero() method yielding true for zero polynomials.
        - Renamed quotrem() operator to divmod().
        - Added overloaded operators: bool ! ** << >> == !=
        - Added methods: is_nonzero(), is_equal(), is_unequal(),
          is_monic(), add_const(), sub_const(), mul_const(), div_const(),
          pow(), pow_mod(), inv_mod(), shift_up(), shift_down(), slice(),
          monize(), mmod(), gcd(), xgcd(), differentiate(), integrate(),
          definite_integral().
        - Renamed eval() method to evaluate() and sub() method to sub_().
        - Removed configure() class method, renamed to_string() method to
          as_string() and added optional configuration parameter.
        - Added lots of configuration options for string representation.
        - Added string_config() method to configure as_string default behaviour
          globally and per object.
        - Added $max_degree class variable to configure parameter
          sanity tests.
        - Changed internal object structure to improve extensibility.
        - Reworked test suite and examples.
        - Reworked pod documentation.
        - Added experimental module Math::Polynomial::Generic.

0.04    2007-07-12
        - New maintainer: Martin Becker.
        - Bugfix [rt.cpan.org #4788] (reported 2003 by prospective
          maintainer): Method tidy() looped endlessly on zero polynomials.
        - Bugfix: Crashed on adding a constant.
        - Bugfix: Crashed on negating via overloaded unary minus.
        - Bugfix: Division of polynomials of equal degree gave wrong results.
        - Bugfix: Division crashed with non-"tidy" polynomials.
        - Bugfix: Division failed to catch zero denominator.
        - Bugfix: Verbose stringification produced lots of warnings under -W.
        - Added more test cases.
        - Renamed example directory, fixed imports and added table of
          contents there.
        - Added some metadata to Makefile.PL.
        - Added documentation of exportable subroutines, moved quotrem to
          subroutines section, clarified some definitions.
        - Moved all imports to top of the module.
        - Added more standard sections to POD, like VERSION, DIAGNOSTICS,
          LICENSE.
        - Added development status notice to README.

0.03    2001-02-23
        - Added more text about interpolation in general and
          Math::Polynomial specifically to the distribution.
        - Fixed a bug where the last constant was omitted if it was one.
          This bug was reported independently by Sergey V. Kolychev,
          John Hurst, and Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS).
        - By a suggestion from Jeffrey S. Haemer (Minolta-QMS) I also
          changed the verbose format slightly to print 'x + -1' as 'x - 1'
          (and similarly for all negative coefficients). For the special
          case, where the first coefficient is negative, the minus sign
          is still printed as if it was part of the coefficient; e.g.,
          '-3*x + 4' is still printed as '-3*x + 4'.
        - By suggestion from John Gamble I moved Math::Interpolate to
          inside the Math::Polynomial package---the subroutine is very
          small and tightly coupled to the Math::Polynomial package.

0.02    1998-08-13
        - Fixed a bug that caused erroneous behaviour when 0 was used
          in the interpolation routine.

0.01    1997-09-11
        - Author: Mats Kindahl
        - Initial release.
